# Hacking Huawei HG8012H ONT
##Steps to hack a HG8012H, access it and mod the firmware


Due to the change from Vodafone to Masm√≥vil network that took place last year by Pepephone ISP, it was necessary to me to obtain an ADSL router compatible with the 802.1q protocol to be able to use the internet connection. This caused me to retire my Asus DSL-N55u router, with which I was very happy with its stability, configuration and WIFI coverage. So, I purchased a Huawei HG556a ADSL router and since this router had a 10/100 switch and pretty mediocre WIFI speed, I also purchased a Linksys EA8500 router that would provide me with the WIFI coverage and gigabit connectivity for my devices. So I configured the Huawei HG556a router in WAN Bridge mode and connected it to the WAN port of the Linksys router. This configuration gave me excellent performance, even more after flashing DD-WRT on the Linksys router.


Now, I have changed the internet operator, moving to a FTTH connection of 500/300 MB with Cableworld and they installed a Huawei HG8245U router and an optical splitter whose coaxial output, connected to home's TV splitter, distributes the TV channels of the service. As I was very happy with the operation and WIFI coverage of the Linksys Ea8500 router, I configured the HG8245U router again in WAN bridge mode and this is the way in which I have been working.
